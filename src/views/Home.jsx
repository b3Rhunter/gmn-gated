	  vote is held. Subscribers, anyone who holds one of the publication‚Äôs NFTs, gather and vote for the day's story. 
	  The journalist whose story is chosen is awarded in the organization's native token PAPER.</h4>
<br></br>
      <p style={{textAlign: "justify"}}><i>Once the votes are counted and the editors approve the copy for publication, the designers go 
	  to work laying out the next day‚Äôs issue. Once complete, the design is deployed to the blockchain and our organization's 
	  NFT updates with the latest story. For every issue of Good Morning News sold, the organization uses half of the proceeds 
	  to buy back the PAPER token and the other half goes towards our PAPER/MATIC liquidity pool.</i></p>
